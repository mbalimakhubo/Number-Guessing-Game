# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple and fun project where the program randomly generates a number within a specific range, and the user attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides hints to guide the user, such as whether the guess was too high or too low, until they successfully guess the number.
