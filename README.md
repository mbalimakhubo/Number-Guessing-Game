# Number Guessing Game

## Description
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple and interactive program where the computer randomly generates a number within a given range, and the user attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback, such as whether the guess was too high or too low, until the correct number is guessed.

## Key Features
- Randomly generates a secret number using Python's `random` library.
- Accepts user input to make guesses.
- Provides feedback for each guess (e.g., "Too High" or "Too Low").
- Tracks the number of attempts to guess correctly.
- Customizable range for the randomly generated number.

## Key Concepts
This project demonstrates essential programming concepts, including:
- **Random Number Generation:** Using the `random` library to generate unpredictable numbers.
- **User Input/Output:** Reading input from the user and displaying feedback.
- **Conditional Logic:** Implementing decision-making through `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run the script in your terminal or preferred IDE.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start guessing!

## Libraries Used
- **random:** Used for generating random numbers.
